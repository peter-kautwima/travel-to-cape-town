          <h2>Wherever you go, we'll be there too</h2>
          <p>
            Visit the website of any of our partners to find out more about
            their services and to book a tour or buy tickets online!
          </p>
          <p>
            Also notice how the links in that paragraph are styled so you can
            style links within your post content area. Links have three styles.
          </p>
          <h4>Never miss out on a deal again</h4>
          <p>
            In this section under the H4 heading, we&#8217;re going to look at
            what the post content, the meat and potatoes of your site looks
            like. In general, you will have multiple paragraphs, so we will add
            another paragraph so you can adjust the spacing in between them to
            the look you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep up-to-date with our special offers, promotions and
            announcements with our newsletter and social media feeds. And don't
            forget to check out our blog for some of the most up-to-date travel
            information around.
          </p>

          <p>
            And we&#8217;ve just tested a paragraph before and after a general
            list along with a nested list to help you see what at least three
            levels of the list will look like. Make sure that each level of the
            list is styled to match your specific needs. You might want to use
            the default disc or circle, or you might want to add graphic bullets
            to your list, too.
          </p>

          <pre>
  This is the pre tag.
  It should be formatted as written
       so if you add spaces to the front of the line
    it will show the spaces and the &lt;code&gt; as written</pre
          >
          <p>
            This should be back to the normal paragraph style and we hope you
            have been paying attention to the margins and padding around each
            element, including the paragraph, so you can position things
            appropriately to the rest of the content.
          </p>
          <h5>We've got you covered</h5>
          <p>
            Cape Town is the second most populous city in South Africa and the
            provincial capital of Western Cape. It is a popular tourist
            destination for international visitors, due to its natural setting,
            varied culture and history, as well as its beautiful coastline.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Travel to Cape Town has all you need for an unforgettable trip:
              from attractions to accommodation deals and entertainment options.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            There are many tags that can be found within a blockquote, just as
            can be found within any container within your web page design, but a
            last example includes an unordered list. Many bloggers love to quote
            examples from lists, so this is a good tag series to test.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Within this web design sandbox test page, we&#8217;ve tested:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Headings</li>
              <li>Text styles like bold and italic</li>
              <li>Ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullets) lists</li>
              <li>Links</li>
              <li>Code and PRE tags</li>
              <li>Blockquotes</li>
              <li>And much more&#8230;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Which should show you what a list looks like within a blockquote.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Each website is unique with it&#8217;s own look and feel for the
            various parts and pieces. This cut and paste section looks only at
            what you might have within your content section. So if you will have
            boxes for lists or little aside information, you will need to add
            them so you can see how they will look in the overall page layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some elements in a

            are controlled by the style sheet, while others are controlled by
            the Template files. Try to work on as much as you can from the style
            sheet first, then you can mess with the template files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, any changes you make to the style sheet and template files
            will be not available if you change themes. If you want them carried
            over, you will need to copy and paste them into the new Theme
            folder.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a last element in the content area and throughout your site,
            check the hypertext links. These are the links to external websites
            and/or internal pages within your site. They come in three flavors:
            active, visited, and hover. Make sure you work on the styles for
            each of these.
