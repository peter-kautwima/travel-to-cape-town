        <h1>This is the H1 Heading</h1>
        <p>
          Above this paragraph should be the H1 heading for your web page. If it
          is not visible, the design settings for the H1 tag is set to
          <code>display:none</code> which many WordPress Themes use to hide the
          blog title text and replace it with a graphic. Do not use H1 within
          your blog post area.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the design in the H1 heading looks like your blog title or blog
          post title, then that is the style set for that HTML tag and you
          should not use it within your blog post area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside of this test data section are most of the basic HTML and XHTML
          and CSS styles that you might use within your WordPress Theme. You
          need to know what that will look like as part of structuring your
          styles.
        </p>
        <h2>This is the H2 Heading</h2>
        <p>
          Above this paragraph should be the H2 heading for your web page.
          WordPress Themes use the h2 heading for various purposes. Logically,
          it should be either the post title or the first heading in the post
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it is used all over WordPress Themes including the subtitle,
          tag line, post title, comment area, sidebar area, and even in the
          footer. Be specific when styling each h2 headings to ensure you are
          not styling all of them.
        </p>
        <h3>This is the H3 Heading</h3>
        <p>
          Is this the same heading as is in your post title or is this the
          section headings found within your sidebar? Or is it different? This
          is the post content heading for the HTML tag h3, as is the one below,
          H4, for section headings within your post to divide up topics. If
          there is an H3 or H4 tag in your sidebar, you will need to identify
          the parent HTML and CSS container for the sidebar and style those
          appropriate in your blog's stylesheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more information in searching for your styles in your WordPress
          blog, see
          <a
            href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Finding_Your_CSS_Styles"
            title="CSS: Studying Your CSS Styles"
            >CSS: Studying Your CSS Styles</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also notice how the links in that paragraph are styled so you can
          style links within your post content area. Links have three styles.
          There is the <a href="#" title="nothing here">link color</a>,
          <a href="#" title="nothing here">link hover color</a>, and
          <a href="#" title="nothing here">visited link color</a>. Be sure and
          design for each style.
        </p>
        <h4>This is the H4 Heading</h4>
        <p>
          In this section under the H4 heading, we&#8217;re going to look at
          what the post content, the meat and potatoes of your site looks like.
          In general, you will have multiple paragraphs, so we will add another
          paragraph so you can adjust the spacing in between them to the look
          you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paragraphs are not just for typing your blog babble, they can also
          hold frame and hold other information within your content area to help
          make the point you want to make in your writing. For instance, you
          will commonly have three types of lists.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>General Lists using the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag</li>
          <li>Ordered Lists using the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag</li>
          <li>
            Definition Lists using the <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> tag
            <ul>
              <li>
                Definition Lists use two other tags to generate the list:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> sets up the word or phrase to be
                    &#8220;defined&#8221;, usually set in bold, and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> sets up the definition, which is
                    usually in a normal or slightly smaller font and indented
                    under the definition.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>And that&#8217;s the end of the lists</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And we&#8217;ve just tested a paragraph before and after a general
          list along with a nested list to help you see what at least three
          levels of the list will look like. Make sure that each level of the
          list is styled to match your specific needs. You might want to use the
          default disc or circle, or you might want to add graphic bullets to
          your list, too.
        </p>
        <h5>This is the H5 Heading</h5>
        <p>
          While the H5 heading is not always used, maybe you might find a need
          for it if your H1 and H2 and H3 headings are used. You might need one
          to two levels of subheadings in your post content, so this one gives
          you another option.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also need to look at the other two lists and then add some images
          and other styles to flesh out your WordPress Theme sandbox.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>You need to do this first.</li>
          <li>
            You need to do this second.
            <ul>
              <li>You could do this in between.</li>
              <li>Or give this a try, too.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>But this is the third and last thing to do.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This should give you an idea of how a nested number list would look on
          your site. Now, let&#8217;s look at a definition list.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>WordPress Themes</dt>
          <dd>
            A WordPress Theme is not a &#8220;skin&#8221;. Though many young
            people call it one. The reality is that a WordPress Theme contains
            many files that come together in various ways to generate a
            WordPress web page. A &#8220;skin&#8221; simply changes the look,
            and rarely the results.
          </dd>
          <dt>WordPress Plugins</dt>
          <dd>
            WordPress Plugins add flexibility, features, and capabilities to
            your WordPress site. There are hundreds to choose from. Some add
            power and control like monitoring and busting comment spam and
            enhancing your administration features. Others add fun things like
            random elements and polling and rating systems.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          And here is another paragraph to show the relationship between the
          various parts and pieces.
        </p>
        <h3>This is the H3 Heading</h3>
        <p>
          <img
            class="alignright"
            src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/daisy1a.jpg"
            alt="Daisy, photograph Copyright Brent VanFossen"
          />If the H3 heading is your in-post section heading, then you need to
          see how it works within the post itself. If it isn&#8217;t, simply
          change the H3 to whatever heading number you are using.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            class="alignleft"
            src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/daisy1a.jpg"
            alt="Daisy, photograph Copyright Brent VanFossen"
          />We need to look at how images, another major feature of most
          WordPress sites, are used within the site. Images tend to sit on the
          left, right, or middle of your post, depending upon how you are using
          them. For an image sitting on the left or right, you need to add
          appropriate padding around the image on the text side to push the text
          away from the image so the text won&#8217;t push up against the edges
          of the image.
        </p>
        <img
          class="aligncenter"
          src="http://lorelle.files.wordpress.com/daisy1a.jpg"
          alt="Daisy, photograph Copyright Brent VanFossen"
        />
        <p>
          A centered image is a little different. It is centered in the middle
          and the text is pushed above and below it.
        </p>
        <p>
          How to add the CSS styles for images is discussed in the Codex
          article,
          <a
            title="Using Images in WordPress"
            href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Images"
            >Using Images</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>Testing Font Looks - H3 Heading</h3>
        <p>
          You will need to test the looks of the different font styles, too.
          <strong>This is bold and THIS IS BOLD.</strong>
          <em>This is italic and THIS IS ITALIC.</em>
          <strong
            ><em
              >This is bold and italic and THIS IS BOLD AND ITALIC.</em
            ></strong
          >
          <code>This is code and THIS IS CODE.</code> And now let&#8217;s look
          at what the PRE tag, also known as the preformatted tag, looks like:
        </p>
        <pre>
This is the pre tag.
It should be formatted as written
     so if you add spaces to the front of the line
  it will show the spaces and the &lt;code&gt; as written</pre
        >
        <p>
          This should be back to the normal paragraph style and we hope you have
          been paying attention to the margins and padding around each element,
          including the paragraph, so you can position things appropriately to
          the rest of the content.
        </p>
        <h5>Your CSS Here - H5 Heading</h5>
        <p>
          Let&#8217;s look at the blockquote, one of the most common tags used
          in most blogs. It is designed to &#8220;frame&#8221; a quote from
          another blog, website, or reference that you are &#8220;quoting&#8221;
          from. For the most part, there are three examples of usage:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            This is a simple quote. It is either preceded or followed by a link
            within the text to the credited source. A blockquote must be
            designed to stand out from the rest of the text content, but it does
            not have to &#8220;really&#8221; stand out, just separate itself
            from the content so we know it&#8217;s not your words.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          A second style to the blockquote is one that includes a citation.
          Under HTML guidelines, this citation should be wrapped in the
          <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> tag and then that tag can be styled to be in
          italics, bold, or whatever look you want in your design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take care with the style of the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> tag as some
          WordPress Themes use it in the comments area. I recommend you style it
          specifically with <code>blockquote cite {style declarations}</code> in
          your stylesheet.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            This is an example of a blockquote which also contains a link to
            <a
              href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_Design_and_Layout"
              title="Blog Design and Layout Tips on the WordPress Codex"

              >WordPress Codex</a
            >, the online manual for WordPress Users, to help you see what links
            will look link within a blockquote.<br />

              ><a
                href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/"
                title="Lorelle on WordPress"
                >Lorelle on WordPress</a
              >, your guide to all things WordPress and blogging</cite
            >
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The citation includes a link and text to help you see what a link and
          text will look like within the cite tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many tags that can be found within a blockquote, just as can
          be found within any container within your web page design, but a last
          example includes an unordered list. Many bloggers love to quote
          examples from lists, so this is a good tag series to test.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Within this web design sandbox test page, we&#8217;ve tested:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Headings</li>
            <li>Text styles like bold and italic</li>
            <li>Ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullets) lists</li>
            <li>Links</li>
            <li>Code and PRE tags</li>
            <li>Blockquotes</li>
            <li>And much more&#8230;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Which should show you what a list looks like within a blockquote.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Each website is unique with it&#8217;s own look and feel for the
          various parts and pieces. This cut and paste section looks only at
          what you might have within your content section. So if you will have
          boxes for lists or little aside information, you will need to add them
          so you can see how they will look in the overall page layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some elements in a
          <a
            title="WordPress Themes"
            href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes"
            >WordPress Theme</a
          >
          are controlled by the style sheet, while others are controlled by the
          Template files. Try to work on as much as you can from the style sheet
          first, then you can mess with the template files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, any changes you make to the style sheet and template files
          will be not available if you change themes. If you want them carried
          over, you will need to copy and paste them into the new Theme folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a last element in the content area and throughout your site, check
          the hypertext links. These are the links to external websites and/or
          internal pages within your site. They come in three flavors: active,
          visited, and hover. Make sure you work on the styles for each of
          these.
